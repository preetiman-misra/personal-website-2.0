### It's been a while...

I've been busy lately. For a _looooong_ 1.5 years, it's been a little disheartening, to be honest. I'm finally done with university and now am a certified MBA (degree and all), but I can't say that life has been as rewarding as it used to be pre-COVID.

It's funny how I was looking forward to the time when I am done with my studies, so that I could take a jump into the real world and somehow escape the monotonous drone of sub-par Indian education, brain damaging, academic life.

I guess life really played an unfunny joke, huh?

> life is just an unfunny joke - _me_

### Hope?

There is a silver lining, probably. I have found an interest. It's a little spark of motivation, and it has got to do with building something real and tangible, unlike the illusion that is software.

What, you ask? It's **Tiny Pocket**.

### Tiny Pocket

> Is a new-age food and wellness company that is involved in the manufacturing, sourcing and distribution of nutraceuticals, food and health ingredients.

The goal of the company is to build a quality focused supply-chain of food production and processing, providing it's customers the best experience in both taste and healthiness _(you can visit [tiny-pocket.com](https://tiny-pocket.com) to learn more)_.

### An experiment?

Yeah, I think of this company as an experiment. _"How naive!"_, you might wonder...but it's okay. I think I need to see this idea through. It's a few times in my life that I get a gut feeling that I should do something and it has always left me a better person, regardless of me "winning" in that given situation. After all, when we all lay on our death beds wondering if it was all worth it, maybe, just maybe, the fact that I have one less regret to worry about will soothe my soul.

### The real reason

**Mission 2025**, is a project that I have a love-hate relationship with. It's a childish vision, yet one that seems to lurk at the back of my mind no matter how much many times I give up on it. Now, what is Mission 2025, you might ask?

The idea is simple. Mission 2025 is a self transformation mission. I came up with the plan back in 2015 (which is a _decade_ before the end date) when I was spending a lot of time imagining what time of person I wanted to become. Beyond material things like career, financial gains or social status, it was about moulding myself into the person I am capable of becoming. The end goal of Mission 2025 is pretty simple, i.e., pick different areas of my life that define the type of person I am and obsessively improve on those areas. Essentialy, **become a video game character leveling up in real life instead of inside a game**.
