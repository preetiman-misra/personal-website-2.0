> *The term **philosophy** quite literally means **"love of wisdom"**. In a broad sense, it is an activity people undertake when they seek to understand fundamental truths about themselves, the world in which they live and their relationships to the world and to each other" - University of Florida*

A philosophy, according to my humble opinion is the expression of an individual's ultimate undertaking in life. Some people look at their life's philosophy under the guise some ***religion***, some through ***empathy*** and some through ***nihilism***.

### Opinions, opinions and opinions

Opinions are just like onions, the more you peel the deeper you go and finally you realize nothing mattered in the first place. But, if opinions really don't matter much, why strive to build a philosophy in the first place? After all, isn't philosophy just another opinion?

### A personal take

Regardless of whether the pursuit of philosophy is futile in the sense that all opinions are just that, opinions, there is an irresistible charm in idealizing an expression of personal perspective. Let me give you an example from my personal quotebook -

> *We're all just killing time till time kills us.*

This statement, or *quote* is an idealization of my most concise outlook on life. It is an opinion, yes but at the same time it is **my truth**.

### Being Merely Presumptuous

The idea of ***Merely Presumptuous*** came to me in the dead of the night during a particularly harrowing time in my life.

To be presumptuous is to "presume", i.e., do something boldly, without any forethought or right. Somehow, I relate the human experience to be the culmination of merely being presumptuous, hence the phrase ***Merely Presumptuous***.

As people, we tend to presume ideas, opinions, truths and philosophies as if they're weightless, yet each little presumption we have, may it be the belief in ideals of god, karma or reciprocation, ultimately end up being the only truth we pursue.

As humans, we only believe in what we believe, and this, is my opinion ðŸ˜‰.

Thanks.
