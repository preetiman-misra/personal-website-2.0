It's 7:41 pm on a Thursday and I am completely clueless about what I should be doing in life. Yeah I mean I have a lot of things I could be doing but there is a noticeable difference betwen _should_ and _could_. Is what I have planned/plan to do the very purpose I should be pursuing? Should I just take the easy way out and do what I am supposed to do? Pursue even higher education?

## The need for education

Education is necessary and I'm not against it at all. In fact, the ability that fascinates me the most is intellectual ability. But at the same time, education as I know it, is not necessarily how it is supposed to be from my perspective. Colleges and universities teach for money, students write papers to get better grades from thier professors, really talented researchers swindle people into funding unnecessary and hopeless pursuits, and it all sucks. Yep, all of it. Especially where I live.

Personally witnessing how many people have published papers for the sake of meeting a quota, with a really high count of papers published but an abysmal number of citations, really goes to show the attitude that institutions put forward when they claim that they are **research oriented**.

## WTF is research though?

_Research_, huh. The word is pretty self explanatory. To research is to search again, probably? I am too lazy to look up the actual definition of the word but to me,

> research means to discover beyond what is observed - me, 2023

And I say discover because there is no such thing as invention. Sure you could argue that planes and cars don't exist and we bring them into existence, but are they not merely modifications to existing materials rather than creations? We merely shape a car, plane, phone or MRI machine, but we do not "birth" them from nothing. If we were able to create a new material from scratch, then it could be argued that it was creation. And only creations are "inventions".

I maybe wrong on the perspective I shared above and it might not resonate with a lot of people, but it is merely my perspective.

## So, what are you going to do about it?

You as in me. I was talking to myself. So, if I believe that the quality of education in my part of the world, and purpose of education in the rest of the world is pretty shitty, I should ideally do something to change that, right? So I will. I will teach. How, when, where, what? I don't know. But I will teach. And I will teach in such a manner that it will leave the self-proclaimed _teachers_ in despair of my capabilities to teach and to learn.

Am I bragging? Yeah. Does it feel good to brag? **HELL YEAH !!!**.

## Ending

In conclusion, I would like to announce something - a new way of understanding your thought process. That is what I am working on. Stay tuned.
